# Workshop Demo Application - Let AI Be Your Docs

This is simple chatbot which i created that uses LLM , langchain and RAG architecture .why it's UNIQUE because unlike other chatbot it retrieves data from custom documentation much faster ,better through vector embeddings.(you can see that work on my previous posts)
‚ú® Key features:
LLM Integration: Custom information from a website is seamlessly integrated into a Large Language Model (LLM), enabling more informed and relevant responses.
Vector Search Index: Utilizing an advanced vector search index, the system rapidly finds the most relevant data. This is powered by embedding keys and the innovative use of Maximum Marginal Relevance (MMR) for pinpoint accuracy.
AI-Powered Responses: The chatbot employs a specially designed template to generate answers, ensuring each response is tailored and context-aware.
Speed and Efficiency: Leveraging vector embedding, this chatbot outpaces traditional models that rely on slower, custom-trained data.
üîç The Result: A faster, smarter, and more efficient chatbot that sets a new standard in AI interaction.
